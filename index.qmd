# Hello!

I am currently a Senior Librarian with the Research and Data Services team in [SMU Libraries](https://library.smu.edu.sg/), where I support and enable computational methods of data analysis in academic research to meet the teaching, research, and learning needs of SMU community. I graduated from Nanyang Technological University in 2018 with a MSc in Information Studies.

When not reading detective fiction or tinkering on stuff in Python or R, I occasionally do some volunteer teaching for the folks at [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/index.html).
